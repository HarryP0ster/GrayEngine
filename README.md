Vulkan Game Engine + WorldEditor [[download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MpZq4rXClwFvNyOUGPborKZa0O5cHLAL/view?usp=sharing)].

## Editor movement controls:
* Esc (with viewport focused) - free camera
* Tab (with viewport focused) - character control
* WASD (with one of above modes active) - move around

For now external libraries are missing, so you won't be able to build it yourself.
